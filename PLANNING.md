# Polaroid Camera Project Planning

## Project Goal
Create a visually appealing and interactive simulation of a Polaroid camera using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus is on realistic appearance and simple, satisfying animations for user interactions.

## Architecture
-   **HTML (`index.html`):** Provides the semantic structure for the camera components.
-   **CSS (`cameracss.css`):** Handles all visual styling of the camera, aiming for a photorealistic look using gradients, shadows, and positioning. No CSS frameworks will be used.
-   **CSS (`style.css`):** Handles the layout of the page and the Polaroid filter.
-   **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Adds interactivity to camera elements (e.g., shutter button click, animations) and camera access. Keep JS vanilla (no external libraries unless absolutely necessary).

## Style & Conventions
-   **CSS:** Use descriptive class names matching the camera parts. Rely heavily on CSS gradients and box-shadows for visual effects. Keep CSS organized and readable.
-   **JavaScript:** Use modern JS features (ES6+). Add comments for complex logic. Ensure code is modular where possible.
-   **File Structure:** Maintain a flat structure for now (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js` in the root).

## Constraints
-   Keep animations simple and performant.
-   Avoid external libraries/frameworks if possible.
-   Ensure compatibility with modern web browsers.
-   Do not add features beyond simple visual interactions (e.g., no actual image processing).
