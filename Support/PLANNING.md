# Polaroid Camera Project Planning

## Project Goal
Create a visually appealing and interactive simulation of a Polaroid camera using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with realistic appearance and simple, satisfying animations for user interactions. All features are now complete.

## Architecture
- **HTML (`index.html`)**: Semantic structure for camera components.
- **CSS (`cameracss.css`)**: Photorealistic camera styling.
- **CSS (`style.css`)**: Page layout and Polaroid filter.
- **CSS (`gallery.css`)**: Gallery modal and grid styling.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**: Camera, filter, and gallery logic (vanilla JS).
- **JavaScript (`ios.js`)**: iOS detection and download logic.
- **CSS (`ios.css`)**: iOS-specific CSS overrides.

## Architecture & Layout Decisions
- Camera and preview use only width/aspect-ratio for scaling.
- Internal elements use percent-based sizing/positioning for proportionality.
- Mobile responsiveness via width/scale in media queries.
- Gallery modal overlays, grid-based, with per-image download/delete.
- Filters are applied via CSS for preview and via ctx.filter for capture (polyfilled on iOS).

## Design Principles
- Single source of truth for scaling (width/aspect-ratio).
- No element movement; all elements maintain relative positions.
- Maintainable, modular CSS and JS.

## Final Feature List
- Responsive, photorealistic camera and Polaroid preview.
- 10 advanced CSS filter effects.
- Gallery modal: view, download (individually), and delete polaroids from browser cache.
- Download All saves each image as a separate PNG (hidden on iOS).
- Camera flip button for devices with multiple cameras.
- All filters are baked into saved images on all platforms (context-filter-polyfill on iOS).
- Keyboard accessibility for all controls.

## Constraints
- No external libraries/frameworks except context-filter-polyfill for iOS canvas filter support.
- Compatible with modern browsers and iOS Safari.
- No new features planned; project is complete.

## Status (2025-04-22)
All planned features are implemented, tested, and documented. The project is considered complete and stable for use.
