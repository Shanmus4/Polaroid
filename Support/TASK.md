# Polaroid Camera Project Tasks

## Completed Tasks
-   **[2025-04-20]** Create basic HTML structure (`index.html`) for the Polaroid camera components. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Implement detailed CSS styling (`cameracss.css`) for a photorealistic camera appearance. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Fix CSS/JS linking issues for local file viewing. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Add initial JavaScript (`script.js`) for shutter button click detection and basic visual feedback. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Create project documentation files (`PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, `README.md`). - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Implement live camera view and Polaroid filter toggle. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Created GitHub repository and pushed all project files. Sensitive files are protected by .gitignore.
-   **[2025-04-20]** Enhanced camera preview UI and filter button: borders removed, rounded corners, soft shadow, animated modern filter button. All new styles in preview-enhanced.css.
-   **[2025-04-20]** Camera preview now scales perfectly to container. Filter button replaced by 5 live filter selectors below preview. Selecting a filter updates the main preview. All new logic and styles modular.
-   **[2025-04-20]** Overhauled layout: camera is now in a `.camera-parent` div, centered and scaled to 0.5x in the upper half; layout is top-down (camera above, preview below). - DONE
-   Finalized a fully responsive Polaroid camera layout that scales proportionally on all screen sizes without element movement or squishing.
-   Refactored both `style.css` and `cameracss.css` to use only aspect-ratio and percentage-based sizing for the camera, top, and bottom sections.
-   Removed all unnecessary flexbox and transform scaling from the camera layout; scaling is now handled by width and aspect-ratio only.
-   Ensured the camera design remains visually consistent and centered, with `.camera-parent` and `.camera` using only width and aspect-ratio for scaling.
-   Created a Polaroid preview area with real-world dimensions (3.6in x 4.5in for the white part, 3.3in x 3.8in for the preview), perfectly centered in its parent container.
-   Updated the HTML structure to use `.camera-parent` and `.polaroid-parent` containers for precise layout control.
-   Implemented responsive mobile scaling for both the camera and Polaroid preview.
-   Cleaned up and simplified all CSS, removing legacy flex and transform logic.
-   All UI elements remain visually aligned and centered at all breakpoints.
-   Added interactive, Material Design filter navigation arrows with hover/focus effects.
-   Implemented Polaroid photo capture: clicking the camera shutter saves the current preview (with white frame and filter) as a PNG in browser storage.
-   Added a floating action button (FAB) for downloading the latest captured Polaroid, styled per Material Design guidelines.
-   Fixed skew/stretch and improved image quality for downloads: captured images now perfectly match the live preview and are high-resolution.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Fixed gallery FAB (floating action button): now always fixed to the viewport, 24px from right/bottom, never overlaps camera/polaroid, robust to all layout/stacking bugs.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Refactored layout and stacking context for robust Material Design compliance and correct FAB placement.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Moved FAB outside all layout containers, made it a gallery button with stub interactivity (removed download logic).
-   **[2025-04-21]** Pushed all code and documentation to GitHub for full sync.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Gallery grid system fully rewritten: CSS grid for desktop (auto-fit, minmax), always wraps to new rows, large images, fixed gap. Mobile grid is always 2 columns, responsive, never overflows.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Polaroid capture logic now guarantees the saved/downloaded image matches the live preview exactly, with correct cropping, no stretching, and includes the full white frame with thick bottom border.
-   **[2025-04-21]** All layout, scaling, and stacking bugs resolved for both camera and gallery views.
-   **[2025-04-21]** All CSS and JS files updated and thoroughly tested for mobile and desktop.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Start gallery feature: In-page modal gallery shows all captured polaroids from browser cache. Each image has individual download. Add "Download All" for ZIP. Modular, documented, and tested per project rules.

## Current Tasks
-   None (all major features complete as of 2025-04-21 18:10)

## Future Tasks / Backlog
-   Implement photo printing animation triggered by shutter click.
-   Add interactivity to other camera elements (e.g., flash toggle, power button).
-   Refine existing animations and styles.
-   Add further interactive features or photo effects as needed.
-   Implement tests or accessibility enhancements if required.

## Discovered During Work
-   The original CSS was messed up, so it was reverted.
-   No major blockers. All layout and scaling issues have been addressed.
