# Polaroid Camera Project Tasks

## Completed Tasks
-   **[2025-04-20]** Create basic HTML structure (`index.html`) for the Polaroid camera components. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Implement detailed CSS styling (`cameracss.css`) for a photorealistic camera appearance. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Fix CSS/JS linking issues for local file viewing. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Add initial JavaScript (`script.js`) for shutter button click detection and basic visual feedback. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Create project documentation files (`PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, `README.md`). - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Implement live camera view and Polaroid filter toggle. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Created GitHub repository and pushed all project files. Sensitive files are protected by .gitignore.
-   **[2025-04-20]** Enhanced camera preview UI and filter button: borders removed, rounded corners, soft shadow, animated modern filter button. All new styles in preview-enhanced.css.
-   **[2025-04-20]** Camera preview now scales perfectly to container. Filter button replaced by 5 live filter selectors below preview. Selecting a filter updates the main preview. All new logic and styles modular.
-   **[2025-04-20]** Overhauled layout: camera is now in a `.camera-parent` div, centered and scaled to 0.5x in the upper half; layout is top-down (camera above, preview below). - DONE
-   Finalized a fully responsive Polaroid camera layout that scales proportionally on all screen sizes without element movement or squishing.
-   Refactored both `style.css` and `cameracss.css` to use only aspect-ratio and percentage-based sizing for the camera, top, and bottom sections.
-   Removed all unnecessary flexbox and transform scaling from the camera layout; scaling is now handled by width and aspect-ratio only.
-   Ensured the camera design remains visually consistent and centered, with `.camera-parent` and `.camera` using only width and aspect-ratio for scaling.
-   Created a Polaroid preview area with real-world dimensions (3.6in x 4.5in for the white part, 3.3in x 3.8in for the preview), perfectly centered in its parent container.
-   Updated the HTML structure to use `.camera-parent` and `.polaroid-parent` containers for precise layout control.
-   Implemented responsive mobile scaling for both the camera and Polaroid preview.
-   Cleaned up and simplified all CSS, removing legacy flex and transform logic.
-   All UI elements remain visually aligned and centered at all breakpoints.

## Current Tasks
*(None)*

## Future Tasks / Backlog
-   Implement photo printing animation triggered by shutter click.
-   Add interactivity to other camera elements (e.g., flash toggle, power button).
-   Refine existing animations and styles.
-   Add further interactive features or photo effects as needed.
-   Implement tests or accessibility enhancements if required.

## Discovered During Work
-   The original CSS was messed up, so it was reverted.
-   No major blockers. All layout and scaling issues have been addressed.
