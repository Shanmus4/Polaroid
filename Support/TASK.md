# Polaroid Camera Project Tasks

## Completed Tasks
-   **[2025-04-20]** Create basic HTML structure (`index.html`) for the Polaroid camera components. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Implement detailed CSS styling (`cameracss.css`) for a photorealistic camera appearance. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Fix CSS/JS linking issues for local file viewing. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Add initial JavaScript (`script.js`) for shutter button click detection and basic visual feedback. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Create project documentation files (`PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, `README.md`). - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Implement live camera view and Polaroid filter toggle. - DONE
-   **[2025-04-20]** Created GitHub repository and pushed all project files. Sensitive files are protected by .gitignore.
-   Finalized a fully responsive Polaroid camera layout that scales proportionally on all screen sizes without element movement or squishing.
-   Refactored both `style.css` and `cameracss.css` to use only aspect-ratio and percentage-based sizing for the camera, top, and bottom sections.
-   Removed all unnecessary flexbox and transform scaling from the camera layout; scaling is now handled by width and aspect-ratio only.
-   Ensured the camera design remains visually consistent and centered, with `.camera-parent` and `.camera` using only width and aspect-ratio for scaling.
-   Created a Polaroid preview area with real-world dimensions (3.6in x 4.5in for the white part, 3.3in x 3.8in for the preview), perfectly centered in its parent container.
-   Updated the HTML structure to use `.camera-parent` and `.polaroid-parent` containers for precise layout control.
-   Implemented responsive mobile scaling for both the camera and Polaroid preview.
-   Cleaned up and simplified all CSS, removing legacy flex and transform logic.
-   All UI elements remain visually aligned and centered at all breakpoints.
-   Added interactive, Material Design filter navigation arrows with hover/focus effects.
-   Implemented Polaroid photo capture: clicking the camera shutter saves the current preview (with white frame and filter) as a PNG in browser storage.
-   Added a floating action button (FAB) for gallery access, styled per Material Design guidelines.
-   Fixed skew/stretch and improved image quality for downloads: captured images now perfectly match the live preview and are high-resolution.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Fixed gallery FAB (floating action button): now always fixed to the viewport, 24px from right/bottom, never overlaps camera/polaroid, robust to all layout/stacking bugs.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Refactored layout and stacking context for robust Material Design compliance and correct FAB placement.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Moved FAB outside all layout containers, made it a gallery button with stub interactivity (removed download logic).
-   **[2025-04-21]** Pushed all code and documentation to GitHub for full sync.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Gallery grid system fully rewritten: CSS grid for desktop (auto-fit, minmax), always wraps to new rows, large images, fixed gap. Mobile grid is always 2 columns, responsive, never overflows.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Polaroid capture logic now guarantees the saved/downloaded image matches the live preview exactly, with correct cropping, no stretching, and includes the full white frame with thick bottom border.
-   **[2025-04-21]** All layout, scaling, and stacking bugs resolved for both camera and gallery views.
-   **[2025-04-21]** All CSS and JS files updated and thoroughly tested for mobile and desktop.
-   **[2025-04-21]** Start gallery feature: In-page modal gallery shows all captured polaroids from browser cache. Each image has individual download and delete. "Download All" saves each image as a separate PNG (not ZIP); button is hidden on iOS.
-   **[2025-04-21 18:27]** Added camera flip button to polaroid preview. Button is visible only on mobile devices with both cameras, and always on iOS. Uses Material icon with translucent background. Fully tested and working on iPhone Chrome.
-   **[2025-04-21 19:56]** Gallery modal now updates immediately when a new image is captured. Arrow keys and buttons switch filters for preview/capture.
-   **[2025-04-21 21:09]** Enhanced and expanded CSS filter system: 10 complex, visually rich polaroid filters (warm, cool, retro, vivid, sharp, B&W, night, glow, fade, none). All filter effects are now strictly confined to the image preview areaâ€”no leaks onto the frame or background.
-   **[2025-04-21 21:09]** Updated filter logic in JS: toggles filter classes for live preview and captured images. No more direct style.filter assignment.
-   **[2025-04-21 21:09]** Download All now downloads each image individually (no ZIP). Each polaroid is saved as a PNG with a unique filename. Hidden on iOS.
-   **[2025-04-21 21:09]** All gallery, filter, and capture features tested and verified to work on both desktop and mobile.
- All planned features, UI, and architecture are now complete as of 2025-04-22.
- Responsive HTML/CSS camera layout and Polaroid preview.
- 10 advanced CSS filter effects.
- Gallery modal: view, download (individually), and delete polaroids from browser cache.
- Download All saves each image as a separate PNG (hidden on iOS).
- Camera flip button for devices with multiple cameras.
- Filters are baked into saved/downloaded images on all platforms (context-filter-polyfill for iOS).
- Keyboard accessibility for all controls.
- iOS-specific logic for gallery downloads, with clear user instructions.
- Documentation and planning files are up to date.
