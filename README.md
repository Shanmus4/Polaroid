# Polaroid Camera Web App

A responsive, visually-accurate Polaroid camera web UI with real-time camera preview and true-to-life Polaroid photo proportions.

## Features
- Fully responsive camera layout that scales smoothly on all screen sizes
- Camera design remains visually stable and proportionally correctâ€”no element shuffling or squishing
- Real-world Polaroid preview (3.6in x 4.5in white, 3.3in x 3.8in preview)
- Clean, modern CSS using only width, aspect-ratio, and percent-based sizing
- Mobile-optimized: camera and preview scale down together
- Simple, maintainable HTML and CSS structure

## New Features
- Material Design filter navigation arrows with smooth interactivity.
- Capture Polaroid: Click the camera shutter to save the current preview (with white border and filter) as a high-res PNG.
- Download FAB: Floating action button for downloading the latest captured Polaroid, always visible and styled per Material Design 3.
- Skew-free, high-quality image capture that matches the live preview exactly.

## How It Works
- The camera and preview use only width and aspect-ratio for scaling; no flexbox or transform scaling is used for responsiveness
- All internal elements use percent-based sizing for perfect proportionality
- The Polaroid preview is centered in its parent container using flexbox
- Layout is controlled by `.camera-parent` (camera area) and `.polaroid-parent` (preview area)

## Usage
1. Use the left/right arrows to change filters on the Polaroid preview.
2. Click the red camera shutter button to capture the current photo (with frame and filter).
3. Click the download FAB to save the latest captured Polaroid as a PNG.

All controls are keyboard accessible. Images are stored in browser cache (localStorage) until downloaded.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure
- `style.css`: Layout, scaling, and Polaroid preview styles
- `cameracss.css`: Camera component and internal element styles
- `script.js`: Camera access and preview logic
- `TASK.md`: Task tracking and project history
- `PLANNING.md`: (If present) Design and architecture notes

## Setup
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Allow camera access for real-time preview

## TODO / Roadmap
- Improve accessibility and add tests
